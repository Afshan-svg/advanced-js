# Javascript and classes

Javascript is primarily a prototype based language and not an OOPS, Functional based language
oops just for c++, java developers

## OOPS 
# Objects
- collection of properties and methods
- toLowercase, toDate

## Parts of OOP
- Constructor
- Classes
- Prototypes
- Instances (this, new)

# 4 Pillars of OOPS
- Encapsulation // Wrapper on data
- Abstraction  //hiding details like fetch
- Polymorphism  // poly many morphism methods
- Inheritance
